Thanks for checking out this [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) coding. This is my solution to the [Intro section with dropdown navigation](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/intro-section-with-dropdown-navigation-ryaPetHE5). I have to build this application using only the preview images and the especifications.

## About

This is a simple responsive dropdown navigation menu with some effects using pure HTML, CSS and JS.  I added and created modal login form, a simple TODO list app and social media login form.

Your users should be able to:

* View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
* View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
* See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

Todo: A simple To-Do List Management App that helps you get things done. It can help you keep track of your daily plans. If you happen to have the habit of writing a mission plan, then it must be perfect for you.

A simple TO-DO app to store your todos. This also have a localStorage saving feature.

We all write out to-dos some where and then just forget them. At the end, nothing is done. But you can use this online to-do list app to store all your to-dos. Now if you just re-open the site you will have all your to-dos saved there waiting for you to check them.
